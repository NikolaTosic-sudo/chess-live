# Running Chess Live with Docker

### First time
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Next runs
```bash
docker compose up
```

### ðŸ”„ Rebuilding After Code Changes

If you **or I** make changes to the code, youâ€™ll need to rebuild the Docker image before running the app again:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This ensures Docker picks up the new code and dependencies.

- âœ… **First run** â†’ always use `--build`
- âœ… **After any code changes** (your own or pulled from GitHub) â†’ run with `--build`
- âš¡ **No code changes** and just restarting the app â†’ you can skip rebuilding and run:
```bash
docker compose up
```
