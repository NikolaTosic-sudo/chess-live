# Chess Live ♟️

A modern web-based chess platform built with **Go**, **HTMX**, **Templ**, and **PostgreSQL**.  
The app supports both **local and online play**, user authentication, match history, and game reviews.  

> ⚠️ The project is still under active development. Currently, online play is only available with yourself...in a different browser 😅  
> Docker setup is available and public hosting will be available soon.

## Why Chess ♟️

Simply put, I love playing chess, and it seemed like a great project to combine
my previous knowledge of frontend (with practicing "pure HTML", tailwind and making requests with HTMX),
my new-found knowledge of backend, and my love for chess.

## 📦 Installation

### <img src="https://www.docker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Moby-logo.png" alt="docker" width="40"/> Running with Docker

### First time
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Next runs
```bash
docker compose up
```

### 🔄 Rebuilding After Code Changes

If you **or I** make changes to the code, you’ll need to rebuild the Docker image before running the app again:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This ensures Docker picks up the new code and dependencies.

- ✅ **First run** → always use `--build`
- ✅ **After any code changes** (your own or pulled from GitHub) → run with `--build`
- ⚡ **No code changes** and just restarting the app → you can skip rebuilding and run:
```bash
docker compose up
```

If you want to explore the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NikolaTosic-sudo/chess-live
cd chess-live
```
